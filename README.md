The proposed Attention-Based LSTM model utilizes diverse datasets for requirement classification, including the expanded PROMISE dataset , the Software Requirements Risk dataset, the privacy Requirements dataset. and additional requirements obtained from online. The details of these dataset are mentioned below:

**PROMISE dataset**
The modelâ€™s efficacy has been evaluated using a public repository, namely PROMISE _exp, which is an expanded variant of the original PROMISE dataset. The repository was designed to promote replicable, verifiable, defensible, and improvable predictive models in the discipline of software engineering. The original repository consists of a pre-labeled collection of 255 FRs and 370 NFRs, with the latter sub-classified into 11 distinct NFR categories. The extended version contains 969 requirements, which include 444 FRs and 525 NFRs. As the NFRs are further categorized into 11 distinct types, there is an unequal distribution of requirements across these sub-classes. This class imbalance issue arises due to a relatively lower number of requirements present in the sub-classes. Class distribution is only balanced when all sub-classes of non-functional requirements are grouped into a single class of NFRs. For this reason, this work is limited to the prediction of binary classification, whether a requirement is FR or NFR 

**Software Requirements Risk dataset**
The imperative nature of predicting risks in software development for timely recognition, categorization, and prioritization necessitates a comprehensive approach. To address this, introduces a dataset encompassing attributes related to both software requirements and risks, aiming to facilitate the prediction of risks associated with new software requirements. The dataset comprises 299 instances, each representing a requirement. Among these instances, 162 are classified as functional requirements. The remaining 137 requirements are categorized into subtypes, namely Usability, Reliability & Availability, Performance, Security, Supportability, Constraints, Interfaces, Standards, and Safety. To mitigate potential issues related to class imbalance, these subcategories of non-functional requirements are consolidated into a single non-functional category.

**The privacy Requirements dataset**
This dataset focuses on detecting privacy disclosures within User Stories (USs) to facilitate accurate predictions. Specifically, the required data should encompass a collection of USs, each augmented with a label denoting the presence or absence of privacy disclosures, and an extensive set of features contributing to the identification of privacy relations. Despite a comprehensive search across both web and literature sources, datasets meeting these criteria were not found. Consequently, there was a imperative to construct such a dataset, commencing with a pool of USs from which relevant characteristics essential for the model's reliability could be derived. To address this, conducts an extensive search to identify a sizable collection of USs, leading to the discovery of 22 publicly available datasets, each comprising more than 50 USs [ https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/7zbk8zsd8y/1 ]. The aforementioned dataset, focused on privacy requirements, comprises a total of 1764 requirements. However, the classification of these requirements as functional or non-functional is not specified. To rectify this, the requirements were annotated using the ATT-LSTM model, ensuring a more comprehensive understanding of their nature.

**Others (Online & Kaggale)**
In an effort to enhance prediction accuracy, we incorporated requirements gathered from online sources. The dataset comprises a total of 161 requirements, with 36 sourced from websites and 125 collected from Kaggle, specifically from datasets such as the Software Requirements Dataset, Spotify dataset, and Instagram dataset. The data collection process involved manual extraction, and each requirement was labeled as either functional or non-functional based on the predictions generated by the model.
